# AI Model Derivative Registration Refactoring

## Overview

This document describes the refactoring of AI model registration to ensure **all AI models are registered as derivatives of their training images**, as required by Story Protocol best practices.

## Problem Statement

### Original Issue

- Training was successful but derivative IP registration was failing
- Database showed `ip_id: null` for trained models
- No derivative registration transactions appeared on Story Protocol explorer

### Root Cause Analysis

Through detailed investigation, we identified the core issue:

**Training images were registered without license terms, preventing them from being used as parent IPs for derivative registration.**

### Error Details

```
"License terms id 1 must be attached to the parent ipId 0x8dFC110B74693eE6cda8Eb5a2c2a8aa54e6347F2 before registering derivative."
```

## Solution Implementation

### 1. License Terms Requirement Fix

**Issue**: `mintAndRegisterIpAndMakeDerivative` required one license terms ID per parent IP, but we were only providing one.

**Before**:

```typescript
licenseTermsIds: [BigInt(params.licenseTermsId)], // ‚ùå Only one ID for multiple parents
```

**After**:

```typescript
licenseTermsIds: params.parentIpIds.map(() => BigInt(params.licenseTermsId)), // ‚úÖ One ID per parent
```

### 2. Enforced Derivative-Only Registration

**Before**: AI models could fall back to standalone registration if derivative registration failed.

**After**: AI models MUST be derivatives - no fallback allowed.

```typescript
// AI models must ALWAYS be derivatives of training images
if (registeredImageIPs.length === 0) {
  console.error(
    `‚ùå [IP_REGISTRATION] No training images registered as IP assets. Cannot register AI model.`
  )
  console.error(
    `‚ùå [IP_REGISTRATION] AI models must be derivatives of training images. Aborting registration.`
  )
  return
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Logging

Added comprehensive logging throughout the registration process:

- `[IP_REGISTRATION]` prefix for all model registration logs
- Detailed parameter tracking
- Parent IP relationship validation
- Error context preservation

### 4. Future Training Image Registration

Updated training image registration to use license terms from the start:

```typescript
// Use PIL terms registration for training images to enable derivative relationships
const ipResult = await withRetry(async () => {
  return await mintAndRegisterIpWithPilTerms({
    spgNftContract: spgContract,
    metadata: ipMetadata,
  })
})
```

## Architecture Changes

### File Changes

1. **`lib/story-protocol.ts`**:

   - Renamed `registerDerivativeWithLicenseTerms` ‚Üí `mintAndRegisterIpAndMakeDerivative`
   - Fixed license terms ID mapping for multiple parents
   - Added `mintAndRegisterIpWithPilTerms` for future training images

2. **`app/api/replicate-webhook/route.ts`**:

   - Removed license token minting approach
   - Simplified to direct derivative registration
   - Enforced derivative-only policy
   - Enhanced error handling and logging

3. **`app/api/process-uploaded-files/route.ts`**:
   - Updated to use `mintAndRegisterIpWithPilTerms` for training images
   - Ensures license terms are attached during registration

## Story Protocol IP Hierarchy

The refactored system creates a clean three-tier IP hierarchy:

```
Training Images (with license terms)
          ‚Üì
     AI Model (derivative)
          ‚Üì
Generated Images (future derivatives)
```

### Benefits

- **Proper IP relationships**: All AI models are derivatives of training data
- **License compliance**: Automatic license propagation from training images
- **Future-ready**: Generated images can be derivatives of AI models
- **No license token complexity**: Direct license terms approach

## Testing Results

### Successful Test Cases

1. ‚úÖ Training image IP registration with license terms
2. ‚úÖ AI model derivative registration with proper license terms mapping
3. ‚úÖ Enhanced logging and error reporting
4. ‚úÖ Database updates with derivative relationships

### Error Handling

- **No parent IPs**: Registration aborts with clear error message
- **Derivative failure**: No fallback to standalone registration
- **License terms missing**: Clear error pointing to root cause

## Deployment Notes

### For Existing Models

- Existing models without derivative relationships will remain as-is
- New webhook events will trigger the enhanced derivative registration
- Manual re-registration possible via webhook replay

### For New Training Jobs

- Training images automatically registered with license terms
- AI models automatically registered as derivatives
- Full IP hierarchy established from the start

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Derivative Registration Success Rate**: Should be 100% for new models
2. **License Terms Attachment**: All training images should have license terms
3. **IP Hierarchy Completeness**: Every AI model should have parent IPs
4. **Transaction Success**: Monitor Story Protocol transactions

### Log Patterns to Watch

- `‚úÖ [IP_REGISTRATION] Successfully registered AI model as derivative IP`
- `‚ùå [IP_REGISTRATION] AI models must be derivatives. No fallback to standalone registration.`
- `üîó [IP_REGISTRATION] Registering AI model as derivative of N training image IPs`

## Future Enhancements

### Generated Image Derivatives

Ready to implement generated image registration as derivatives:

```typescript
await mintAndRegisterIpAndMakeDerivative({
  spgNftContract: spgContract,
  parentIpIds: [aiModelIpId], // Generated image derives from AI model
  licenseTermsId: "1",
  metadata: generatedImageMetadata,
})
```

### Batch Processing

- Batch training image registration for improved efficiency
- Batch derivative registration for multiple AI models
- Optimized gas usage patterns

## Conclusion

This refactoring ensures that:

1. **All AI models are properly registered as derivatives** of their training images
2. **License terms flow correctly** through the IP hierarchy
3. **The system is future-ready** for generated image derivative registration
4. **Error handling is comprehensive** with clear debugging information

The implementation follows Story Protocol best practices and establishes a solid foundation for intellectual property management in AI training workflows.
